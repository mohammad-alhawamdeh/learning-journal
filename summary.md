# Whats markdown
Markdown is a way to style text on the web.
You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.
Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown.
