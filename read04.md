# structure web page with HTML :

 The  HTML introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already.

 ## div
  Web page authors used <div> elements to group together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a header, an article, footer or sidebar). Authors used class or id attributes to indicate the role of the <div> element in the structure of the page.

 ## Headers & FooTers :
  The <header> and <footer> elements can be used for:
   1. The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.
   2. A header or footer  for an individual <article> or <section> within the page.

   ## navigaTion
    * <nav>
   The <nav> element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.

   ## ArTicLes :
   * <article>
    The <article> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.
   This could be an individual article or blog entry, a comment or forum post, or any other independent piece of content.
   If a page contains several articles (or even summaries of several articles), then each individual article would live inside its own <article> element.

   ## section :
   The <section> element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.

  <iframes> X cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
  The  X <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
